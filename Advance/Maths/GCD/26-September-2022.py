# 1 : Delete one

# Given an integer array A of size N. You have to delete one element such that the GCD(Greatest common divisor) of the remaining array is maximum.
# Find the maximum value of GCD.

# Input 1:
#  A = [12, 15, 18]

# Output 1:
#  6

#  Explanation 1:
#  If you delete 12, gcd will be 3.
#  If you delete 15, gcd will be 6.
#  If you delete 18, gcd will 3.
#  Maximum vallue of gcd is 6.

# 2 : Enumerating GCD

# You are given a number A and a number B. Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of all numbers between A and B inclusive is taken (GCD(A, A+1, A+2 ... B)).
# As this problem looks a bit easy, it is given that numbers A and B can be in the range of 10100.
# You have to return the value of GCD found.
# The greatest common divisor of 2 numbers, A and B, is the largest number, D that divides both A and B perfectly.

# Example Input
# A = "1"
# B = "3"

# Example Output
# 1

# Example Explanation
# Greatest divisor that divides both 1 and 3 is 1.

# Solution ðŸ‘‡

# Idea: GCD of two consecutive number is always 1.
# Proof: 
# -> Let a and b are two consecutive integers such that b = a + 1
# -> Let Say GCD(a,b) = x , that means a is divisible by x and
# -> according to that next number that could be divisible by x is a + x.
# -> that means a + x should be equal to b, which means
# -> a + x = b => a + x = a + 1 => x = 1 => GCD(a,b) = 1

# -> which proves that GCD of two consecutive number is 1.

# 3 : Pubg

# There are N players, each with strength A[i]. when player i attack player j, player j strength reduces to max(0, A[j]-A[i]). When a player's strength reaches zero, it loses the game, and the game continues in the same manner among other players until only 1 survivor remains.

# Explanation 1:

# Given strength array A = [6, 4]
# Second player attack first player, A =  [2, 4]
# First player attack second player twice. [2, 0]
